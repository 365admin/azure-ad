# Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formaing words as
bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly,
Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

All of the articles in docs.microsoft.com repositories use [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).
